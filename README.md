## Bayesian calibration of energy models using Stan

The stan code for Bayesian calibration is based on [Kennedy and O'Hagan's (2001)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9868.00294) Bayesian calibration framework and follows the statistical approach described in [Higdon et. al. (2004)](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S1064827503426693).

Stan is portable across [many computing environments](http://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/). Two interfaces, R ([main.R](https://github.com/adChong/bc-stan/blob/master/src/main.R)) and Python ([main.py](https://github.com/adChong/bc-stan/blob/master/src/main.py)) are provided here to interface with the stan models in this repository.

### Prerequisites

Install Stan and its required dependencies.
* RStan (R interface to stan): https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started
* PyStan (Python interface to stan): http://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_beginner.html

### Usage

Main files
1. [main.R](https://github.com/adChong/bc-stan/blob/master/src/main.R): R interface for running Stan model
2. [main.py](https://github.com/adChong/bc-stan/blob/master/src/main.py): Python interface for running Stan model
3. [bcWithPred.stan](https://github.com/adChong/bc-stan/blob/master/src/bcWithPred.stan): Stan model for Bayesian calibration of building energy models with predictive inferences.
4. [bcWithoutPred.stan](https://github.com/adChong/bc-stan/blob/master/src/bcWithoutPred.stan): Stan model for Bayesian calibration of building energy models without predictive inferences.

To run Bayesian calibration with predictive inference in Stan, run [main.R](https://github.com/adChong/bc-stan/blob/master/src/main.R) or [main.py](https://github.com/adChong/bc-stan/blob/master/src/main.py) as is.

To run Bayesian calibration with predictive inference outside of Stan, comment lines 60-63 and line 85 and uncomment lines 65-68 and line 86 in [main.R](https://github.com/adChong/bc-stan/blob/master/src/main.R).
